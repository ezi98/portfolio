					<p>Welcome to Call of Duty: Warzone, a large scale, action-packed,
						battleground where players drop onto the core map and
						must fight to survive to be the last Operator or Squad of Operators.</p>

							<li class="item02"><span>/TRAINING/ CALL OF DUTY:WARZONE</span>
								Player, Weapon, and Battle Pass XP progression is limited in Call of Duty: Warzone
								Bootcamp. The new training mode will not progress Daily/Weekly Challenges,
								Calling Card Challenges, Weapon Challenges, or Champion's Quest. Additionally, the new
								training mode will not feature public events or advanced contracts.
								Drop in, learn the ropes, and get ready to take on the world.
								Battle Royale is the classic Call of Duty: Warzone experience with a high risk/reward
								bottom line that allows you and your Squad one full round of life,
								which will be explained later, and ends with one winner
							</li>

							<li class="item06"><strong>The gas</strong>The objective of Call of Duty: Warzone is to
								survive until you're the last player or squad on the map.
								In phases, the map will force players into one isolated location by releasing poisonous
								gas from the edges of the map.
								You can survive in the gas for a short amount of time</li>
							<li class="item07"><strong>almazra</strong>The Gulag is a 1v1 faceoff with someone else who
								was recently eliminated as well.
								You'll drop into a room with cover obstacles and a simple Loadout. Both players will
								start with the same Loadout and must eliminate the other or use the ascender to exfil
								that appears in the middle of the room. The winner will automatically be redeployed back
								into the fight where they can find a safe place to land and attempt to regroup with
								their Squad.</li>
							<li class="item08"><strong>The gulag</strong>The Gulag is a 1v1 faceoff with someone else

								Enter the Multiplayer Lobby. Consider adjusting the Quick Play filter to include only
								Team Deathmatch, Free-for-All, and Domination.

								Play a match and fine-tune your Controller and Graphics settings to preference. Get to
								these settings by pressing the button prompt to open the top right menu, then navigating
								to the gear icon.

								Your first adjustments will likely be the Button Layout Preset in the Controller
								category and your horizontal and vertical stick sensitivity under the Aiming category.
								Under Graphics, adjust the Field of View settings to determine the height and width of
								your in-game view. This may take a few games to perfect.

							<li class="item06"><strong>6v6 Modes</strong>TOn Shipment, it's easy to get caught up in the
								whirlwind of battle, especially when you're slaying. The highest kill count won't
								impress your teammates, however, if you've got a measly objective score and end up
								losing the match.</li>
							<li class="item07"><strong>Killstreaks</strong>The Gulag is a 1v1 faceoff with someone else
								who was recently eliminated as well. You'll drop into a room with cover obstacles and a
								simple Loadout. Both players will start with the same Loadout and must eliminate the
								other or use the ascender to exfil that appears in the middle of the room.
								The winner will automatically be redeployed back into the fight where they can find a
								safe place to land and attempt to regroup with their Squad.</li>
							<li class="item08"><strong>Search & Destroy</strong>Mission Parameters:Search & Destroy is a
								round-based objective game mode where each player has only one life per round.
								At the start of each round, one team is put on offense and one team is put on defense.
